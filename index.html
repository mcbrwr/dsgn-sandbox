<h1>Design Sandbox</h1>
<p>A sandbox for design patterns that can be created with just some html/css and a bit of creativity.</p>
<p>Currently working on some design patterns based on spreads in magazines. Trying to translate, not transfer, as in <a href="https://twitter.com/jensimmons">Jen Simmons'</a> great talk about <a href="http://aneventapart.com/news/post/modern-layouts-getting-out-of-our-ruts-by-jen-simmons-an-event-apart-video">Modern Layouts</a> at An Event Apart.</p>
<p><em>Note: </em>All design are technical sketches just to get some point across. Untested in any other browser or any other screensize and not progressively enhanced in any way. They work on Mac/Chrome at about the size of a regular laptop, that's all I'm sure of ;-)</p>
